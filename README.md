# {Morphograph}

**Morphograph** creates visual scores for sounds. This software is a proof of concept based on **Ocular scores** by Linda Bouchard.

Build instructions (from root folder):

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make

The binary file will be in build/src. To launch:

./morphograph

The tool will produce a file called test.svg in the same folder. To test other samples, edit the main file.
